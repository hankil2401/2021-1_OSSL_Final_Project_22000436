<h1>1. What does this project do?</h1>
- This project is the combination of many types of converter for Length, Temperature, Weight, Speed, Time.
<br/>
- The program reads inputs from the users and calculate the result. Then it will shows the result.

<h1>2. Why is this project useful?</h1>
- This project can help people convert faster just by giving the original value and measurement and the willing measurement.<br/>
- Maybe some of them are easy to convert, but some have quite complicated equations, but by this converter, it will give out the result just after who enter the input. 

<h1>3. How to get started, or use this project?</h1>
Step 1: Clone this project in to your own repository.<br/>
Step 2: compile the main.c source code (gcc main.c).<br/>
Step 3: run the code ./a.out(or a.exe,... depends on your terminal) (or whatever the name of the execution file you named.<br/>
Step 4: It will ask you to enter the value and the measurement (ex: 10 cm, 25 km, 36 C,...), so type in the value you want to convert.<br/>
Step 5: Then it will ask you to enter the measurement unit you want to be the result (ex: miles, km, m, F, K, pound, feets,...).<br/>
Step 6: It will continually ask until you type "0 done" when it ask for inital value and measurement.<br/>
